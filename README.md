# Handwritten-Mathematical-Expressions-Recognition-and-Calculation

This project, titled ‘Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition and Calculation,’ was developed jointly with our colleagues at Gaziosmanpaşa University in Tokat as part of a course.

In this project, we developed an OCR system with high accuracy rates, trained using a special data set created and labelled by us.

Simple mathematical expressions written in handwriting on images are detected, digitised, and solved. The system uses the YOLOv11l model to recognise symbols, which are then sorted according to their x-y coordinates to form meaningful mathematical expressions. These expressions are solved using the SymPy library. 

The developed system is presented as a web application with a user interface.

If you want to run the project on your own computer, you can use the main.py file. If you want to try it on Hugging Face, you can use the app.py file.
